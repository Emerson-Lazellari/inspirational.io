  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> [Today's date]</p>
  
  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We collect only the information necessary to post content to your TikTok account: your TikTok access token (obtained through TikTok's OAuth) and basic account information provided by TikTok's API.</p>
  
  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>We use your TikTok authorization solely to post content you've generated through our service. We do not sell, rent, or share your data with third parties for marketing.</p>
  
  <h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
  <p>Access tokens are stored locally on your device or in your environment configuration. We do not operate servers that store your personal data.</p>
  
  <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>Our service integrates with TikTok, OpenAI, and Pexels. Each has their own privacy policy. We encourage you to review them.</p>
  
  <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>You can revoke our access to your TikTok account at any time through TikTok's app settings. This will stop all future posting.</p>
  
  <h2>6. Contact</h2>
  <p>For privacy questions, contact us at [your-email@example.com].</p>
